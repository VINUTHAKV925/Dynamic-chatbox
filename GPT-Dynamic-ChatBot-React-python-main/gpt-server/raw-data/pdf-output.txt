Assignment Description: You are tasked with creating a web application that retrieves data from a 
public API and displays it using a React.js frontend. The application will have the following key 
components:  
1. Backend  (Node.js):  
• Create a Node.js s erver using Express.js to serve the frontend and handle API 
requests.  
• Set up routes for fetching data from a public API. You can choose any public API 
you prefer (e.g., a weather API, cryptocurrency data, news API, etc.).  
• Implement error handling for API r equests and responses.  
• Parse and format the API data as needed before sending it to the frontend.  
2. Frontend  (React.js):  
• Create a React.js application that communicates with the Node.js backend.  
• Implement a user interface to display the data retrieved from t he API.  
• Use React components and state management to update the UI when new data is 
fetched.  
• Include error handling for any issues that may occur during data retrieval.  
• Provide a clean and user -friendly design using CSS or a CSS framework of your 
choice (e .g., Bootstrap, Material -UI). 
3. Optional  Features  (Choose  at least  one):  
• Implement client -side filtering or sorting options for the displayed data.  
• Add pagination to display a limited number of items per page.  
• Implement a search feature to allow users to search for specific data within the 
results.  
• Include unit tests for the React components or Node.js server (testing library and 
frameworks like Jest or Mocha/Chai).  
Submission Guidelines:  
• Create a public GitHub repository to host your project.  
• Include a README.md file with instructions on how to run the application and any 
additional information you deem necessary.  
• Ensure that your code is well -documen ted and follows best practices for Node.js and 
React.js development.  
 
 Evaluation Criteria: Candidates will be evaluated based on the following criteria:  
1. Proper API integration and data retrieval.  
2. Effective error handling for API requests and responses.  
3. Quality of the React.js frontend, including user interface design and responsiveness.  
4. Optional feature implementation (if chosen).  
5. Code organization, readability, and documentation.  
6. Submission and repository organization.  
7. Bonus points for unit testing (if implemented).  
Feel free to customize this assignment based on your specific needs and the level of expertise 
you are looking for in your candidates. Be sure to provide clear expectations and evaluation 
criteria to assess the candidates effectively.
